# MageQuest

```
3/31: using Youtube tutorials I've implemented a combat system with health bars.
```

```
4/27: I've learned a lot since my first go-around with this project. I've made some fixes
and plan on finishing this up slowly.
```

```
4/28: Working on the combat system, and added spells! Mostly working on functionality. This
is shaping up to be quite a project. This is less of a readme, and more of a log.
After typing your name, typing minotaur will start the minotaur battle. I got this!
```
```
4/29: Working on weapons and the weapon shop. Added Ice Spire and improved the minotaur<br>
battle sequence. It's now contained within the loop so the values refresh.
```
```
4/30/ 5/1: Finished up the combat system and implemented the shop, and the axe shop.
Started the dragon-rider combat sequence.
```
```
5/5: Wow, so it's been more difficult for me to keep up with this log, than it has
coding the game. Added the first quest, you can buy spell scrolls from the shop,
combat with 2 knights, cutscenes, and the beginning to a dungeon.
