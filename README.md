# MageQuest

My first attempt at creating a text-based RPG game<br>
3/31: using Youtube tutorials I've implemented a combat system with health bars.<br>
<br>
4/27: I've learned a lot since my first go-around with this project. I've made some fixes<br>
and plan on finishing this up slowly.
<br>
4/28: Working on the combat system, and added spells! Mostly working on functionality. This<br>
is shaping up to be quite a project. This is less of a readme, and more of a log.<br>
After typing your name, typing minotaur will start the minotaur battle. I got this!<br>
<br>
4/29: Working on weapons and the weapon shop. Added Ice Spire and improved the minotaur<br>
battle sequence. It's now contained within the loop so the values refresh.<br>
<br>
4/30/ 5/1: Finished up the combat system and implemented the shop, and the axe shop.<br>
Started the dragon-rider combat sequence.<br>
